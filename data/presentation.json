      "narration": "Let’s start with a simple question: how much of your week goes to build scripts, Dockerfiles, cert renewals, DNS tweaks, and chasing down logs and metrics, instead of shipping features?... Today is about taking that time back.\n\nDigitalOcean’s App Platform is a fully managed PaaS that removes the routine DevOps work so you can focus on your core business problem... It uses Cloud Native Buildpacks to detect your language and framework, and it builds a production‑ready image from your source code... No Dockerfile, no custom shell scripts, and no plumbing a CI pipeline just to compile and package your app.\n\nOnce you connect your repo, the platform handles the operational heavy lifting... TLS certificates are issued and renewed automatically, and mapping a custom domain is guided and fast... Logs and metrics are available out of the box, with simple forwarding to your existing observability stack... Deployments roll out safely behind health checks, and you can scale by choosing an instance size and setting min and max counts per component.\n\nIf you like a GitOps flow, an app spec lets you declare services, environment variables, and autoscaling in a few lines of YAML... Push code, and the platform builds, deploys, and keeps things healthy.\n\nWhy now?... Teams are under pressure to ship faster with fewer moving parts... App Platform gives you a paved road: modern build, secure defaults, and production operations without the toil... In the next segment, I’ll connect a repo and show you this in action.",

      "narration": "Let’s kick off with a simple promise: here’s the DevOps pain checklist we’re deleting today... First, build scripts and Dockerfiles... With Cloud Native Buildpacks, App Platform detects your language and builds a secure, reproducible image—no Dockerfile, no custom CI shell gymnastics... Second, certificates and DNS... You map a domain, and the platform provisions and renews TLS automatically, so there are no Certbot cron jobs to babysit... Third, logs and metrics... You get built‑in logs and performance charts out of the box, and you can forward them to providers like Datadog with a couple of fields in your config... Fourth, risky rollouts and manual scaling... App Platform does health‑checked rolling deploys and lets you scale horizontally and vertically without touching a load balancer... Finally, secrets drift... Use encrypted environment variables and database integrations to keep configuration clean and consistent.\n\nHere’s the flow... You push code... Buildpacks detect the runtime and assemble an OCI image... The platform deploys it behind health checks... TLS certificates and DNS wiring are handled for you... Logs and metrics are available immediately, and scaling is just a setting—not a new project... The outcome is that you spend your time on product features, not plumbing.\n\nAnd this is what replaces pages of scripts... In a single app spec, you connect your Git repo to deploy on push, expose the port your service listens on, set instance size and count, define a health check, store your database URL as an encrypted secret, map a custom domain, and forward logs to your existing observability stack... No Dockerfile... No Certbot... No log shipper.\n\nIf any of those pains sounded familiar, you’re in exactly the right place... Next, I’ll show you how this looks end‑to‑end so you can ship faster and leave the DevOps grind behind.",

      "narration": "Let’s look under the hood at how App Platform removes DevOps pain with buildpacks, components, and the App Spec.\n\nFirst, buildpacks... When you connect your repository, App Platform runs Cloud Native Buildpacks to auto-detect your language and framework... It sees a package.json, a requirements.txt, a go.mod, and chooses the right buildpack without you writing a Dockerfile or a custom build script... During the build, it resolves dependencies, applies best-practice defaults, and produces a standard OCI image... It also caches layers so subsequent builds are faster, and it uses secure base images with software bills of materials so you inherit patched runtimes without managing them yourself... If you need to nudge the runtime, you can set an environment variable like BP_NODE_VERSION, and you’re done... No bespoke shell scripts, no maintaining multiple Dockerfiles.\n\nNow components... App Platform gives you three building blocks... Web Services for anything that speaks HTTP—your APIs and web apps... Static Sites for frontends that compile to static assets and get served from a global CDN... And Workers for background jobs and schedulers that don’t need HTTP... The power comes from composing them: an API, a React site, and a queue consumer can live in one app, deploy together, and scale independently... If your API gets a traffic spike, you can autoscale it up without touching the worker.\n\nAll of this is driven by the App Spec, a simple YAML file you keep in your repo... It’s your single source of truth for what to build, how to run it, and how to route traffic... You declare where the source lives—especially handy in a monorepo with source_dir—set environment variables and secrets, define health checks so rolling deploys only shift traffic to healthy instances, and pick instance sizes and counts... You can even pin runtime versions for buildpacks through env vars right in the spec... Because it’s declarative and versioned, you get repeatable, auditable deployments and a clean GitOps workflow.\n\nHere’s the mental model... You push code... App Platform pulls the repo, buildpacks detect the stack, and a reproducible image is built with caching... The platform rolls out the new version, runs health checks, and only then starts sending traffic... Routing, TLS certificates, DNS wiring, logs, and metrics are handled for you... If you want centralized observability, you turn on log forwarding in the spec or the UI... If you need to scale, you set min and max instances and let autoscaling respond to load.\n\nA couple of quick tips... If detection ever picks the wrong thing, add the usual language hints, or set a buildpack runtime variable... In edge cases where you truly need custom OS dependencies, you can switch to a Dockerfile, but start with buildpacks for speed... And always define a lightweight health endpoint so rolling deploys can protect your uptime.\n\nWith buildpacks doing the heavy lifting, components mapped to your architecture, and the App Spec as code, you spend your time on product, not plumbing.",

      "narration": "In this demo, I’m going to take a plain Git repository and turn it into a live, secure URL with autoscaling and streaming logs in just a few minutes, using DigitalOcean’s App Platform... The goal is simple: remove the DevOps pain so you can focus on your application, not on build pipelines, certificates, servers, or logging plumbing.\n\nLet’s start in the code... This is a tiny Node.js service with two routes: the root returns a JSON response, and a slash health endpoint returns okay... Notice that there’s no Dockerfile here... I’m not writing build scripts, base images, or CI runners... I’m keeping it clean and minimal, because App Platform’s Cloud Native Buildpacks will detect Node and build a production-ready image for me automatically.\n\nNow I’ll head over to the DigitalOcean dashboard and create a new app... I’ll connect it to my GitHub repository and select the main branch... If you’re using a monorepo, you can set a source directory so only the right subfolder is built and deployed... App Platform detects that I’m deploying a web service... I’ll make sure the HTTP port is set to eight zero eight zero, and I’ll add a health check on slash health... I’ll choose a small instance size to keep it cost effective, and I’ll leave deploy on push turned on so future merges automatically roll out... That’s it... I click create app, and the build begins.\n\nWhile this is building, take a look at the logs... You’ll see the Buildpacks detection step figure out the runtime and choose the right buildpacks... It installs dependencies, applies sensible defaults, and crucially, it caches layers so future builds are faster... I didn’t write a Dockerfile... I didn’t worry about base image security updates... Buildpacks give me reproducible builds, with far less maintenance.\n\nAs the build completes, App Platform rolls out the new version behind a health check... If it passes, traffic switches over without me touching a load balancer or deployment script... And here we go... The app is live... I’ll click the default domain, which ends in dot on digitalocean dot app... Notice the lock icon in the browser... HTTPS is already enabled... Certificates are provisioned and renewed automatically, no certbot, no cron jobs, no surprise expirations... If I want a custom domain, I can add it in the console... Once DNS is in place, App Platform handles the TLS there too.\n\nLet’s exercise the app quickly... Hitting the root path, I get a JSON response... Hitting slash health returns okay... Simple and working... Now let’s talk about scaling... I’m going to enable autoscaling for this service and set a small range, say a minimum of one instance and a maximum of three... App Platform will watch load and add or remove instances within that range automatically... There’s no need to pre-provision a load balancer or write scaling policies by hand.\n\nTo make this interesting, I’ll generate a bit of load... In a terminal, I’ll run a short load test against the app’s URL... As that runs, watch the metrics and instance count in the App Platform dashboard... You’ll typically see the platform add a second instance, and if the traffic keeps up, a third, then scale back down once demand drops... All of this happens with health checks and rolling behavior so the application stays available during changes... Again, I didn’t configure Nginx, a reverse proxy, or any autoscaling group... It’s baked into the platform.\n\nNow, let’s look at observability... App Platform gives me live logs per component... I can filter by the web service and see the structured JSON logs I printed from the app... If I prefer the command line, I can stream the same logs with doctl, the DigitalOcean CLI... One command follows the logs for this component in real time... If your team centralizes logs in a third-party provider like Datadog or Logtail, you can turn on log forwarding in the UI or declare it in an app spec so it’s repeatable... Metrics for CPU, memory, and request rates are built in, right here in the console, so you can see what’s happening without wiring up agents.\n\nLet me recap what we did not do... We did not write a Dockerfile, not even a multi-stage one... We did not maintain CI shells to build and push images... We did not set up or renew TLS certificates... We did not manage DNS beyond choosing a domain... We did not stand up or tune a load balancer... We did not ship log shippers or glue together metrics dashboards... Instead, we pointed App Platform at a repo, accepted the detected buildpacks, and got a secure URL, autoscaling, metrics, and logs out of the box.\n\nIf you like to keep your infrastructure configuration versioned, you can capture this in a simple app specification file... That YAML declares components, routes, environment variables, and scaling settings... Put it in your repository, and you’ve got an auditable, repeatable deployment path... From there, a GitOps workflow is straightforward: open a pull request, merge to main, and App Platform builds and deploys... Rollbacks are a click away if you need them.\n\nOne final note on best practices... Expose a lightweight health endpoint like we did here so the platform can make good decisions during rolling deploys... Keep configuration in environment variables, and treat the filesystem as ephemeral... If you need persistence, attach a managed database or object storage... And if you do hit truly custom runtime needs, you can still bring your own container image, but start with Buildpacks first for the fastest path.\n\nSo that’s repo to Buildpacks to a live TLS URL, autoscaling, and logs, all in minutes... This is the paved road for shipping applications without the usual DevOps overhead... In the next part of the session, we’ll share the sample repository and app spec so you can try it yourself... Push code, let the platform do the heavy lifting, and spend your time on your core product instead of infrastructure.",

      "narration": "Let’s talk about paved roads that keep you out of operations quicksand... The idea is simple: choose conventions that remove toil so you can focus on your core product... On App Platform, that starts with Cloud Native Buildpacks and an app spec... Instead of custom Dockerfiles and brittle CI scripts, you push code, the platform detects your language, builds a secure image with caching, and ships it... Keep an app.yaml in your repo to describe components, routes, and environment... When you map a custom domain, App Platform provisions and renews TLS for you... No more chasing certificates or wiring DNS by hand.\n\nNext, embrace twelve‑factor configuration... Externalize everything via environment variables and mark secrets as secret... Treat the filesystem as ephemeral; for anything that must persist, attach a Managed Database or use Spaces for object storage... Create a separate app or environment per stage—staging and production should not share credentials... This simple discipline prevents config drift and makes rollbacks predictable.\n\nFor safe deployments, give the platform a lightweight health endpoint, like slash health... With rolling deploys, App Platform only shifts traffic to healthy instances... If a new revision fails that check, it doesn’t take user traffic, and you avoid a bad release turning into an incident... It’s a tiny addition to your code that pays off every time you deploy.\n\nObservability should be on by default... Log in a structured, machine‑parsable format like JSON so it’s easy to filter and query... The platform streams logs in the dashboard and can forward them to your existing provider with a couple of fields in the app spec... Metrics for CPU, memory, and requests are built in, so you can set alerts in your APM instead of stitching together agents and sidecars.\n\nFinally, scale smart and isolate workloads... Right‑size your instances and set minimum and maximum counts per component... Keep your API, your static frontend, and your background workers as separate components so each can scale independently... The platform handles the autoscaling and rolling updates, while you focus on response times and user experience.\n\nSo the paved road looks like this: you push code, Buildpacks produce a secure image, App Platform rolls it out behind automatic TLS and DNS, logs and metrics are available immediately, and each component scales as needed... No complex build scripts, no DIY cert management, no log plumbing... These best practices let you ship faster with less on‑call stress, and that’s the whole point of using App Platform to remove DevOps pain.",

      "narration": "Let’s do a rapid-fire pass on common pitfalls and fast fixes so you can stay out of DevOps weeds... First, buildpack detection... If the platform picks the wrong runtime, give it stronger signals... Add a Procfile, a runtime.txt for Python, or specify engines in package.json for Node... Rebuild, and only fall back to a Dockerfile if you truly need custom OS dependencies... Next, secrets and configuration... Keep configuration in your App Spec and mark sensitive values as secrets... That keeps environments reproducible and avoids drift... Third, the filesystem is ephemeral... Don’t write to local disk for uploads or state... Use a managed database and Spaces for durable storage, and run migrations as part of your deploy or via a short-lived worker... Finally, reliability... Add a lightweight health endpoint and configure instance counts or autoscaling so traffic only hits healthy containers... If you remember this flow—guide buildpacks, externalize secrets, treat disk as transient, and enforce health checks—you’ll avoid most surprises and keep the platform handling the heavy lifting for you.",
